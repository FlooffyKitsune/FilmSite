        <h2>Building Community Through Public Art</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="item">
                    <p>In 1992, a group of community leaders in Portsmouth, Ohio asked, "How can we create pride in our community, improve the local economy, and change a dying part of town into the vibrant place it once was?"</p>
                    <p>This is the story of the local visionaries and extraordinary artists who transformed a drab 2,200 foot section of the town's floodwall into a vast display of public art, history, and pride.</p>

                        <div class="item">
                            <p>Robert Dafford of Lafayette, Louisiana, was chosen as lead artist for the floodwall mural project. An internationally known muralist with over 30 years of experience, Robert has created more than 400 murals throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Viewers will notice that many of the panels bear a three-dimensional illusion: a  hallmark  of Dafford's style that connects the audience to the artwork in a unique and powerful way.</p>
                    <p>Dafford and his associate artists, including Portsmouth native Herb Roe, are contracted to maintain the Portsmouth Floodwall murals, keeping them vibrant despite the elements. Their painting season in Portsmouth is from May through September, where visitors may catch a glimpse of the artists in action.</p>

                <div class="item">
                    <p>The floodwall mural project is an outdoor art gallery depicting the many centuries of Portsmouth, Ohio area history.  Subjects range from the ancient mound building Adena and Hopewell cultures to historic sports figures and local notables like actor Roy Rogers, painter Clarence Carter, baseball manager Branch Rickey, writer Jesse Stuart, and actress Julia Marlowe.</p>
                    <p>The section of floodwall included in the project is 20 feet high and extends for 2,090 feet along Front Street in the historic Boneyfiddle District of downtown Portsmouth. Painting began in 1993. The murals are arranged chronologically from east to west, starting with the depiction of the Mound Builders, who are ancestors of the Shawnee Indians, and ending with murals from the contemporary era.</p>
